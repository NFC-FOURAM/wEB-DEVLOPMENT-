    <h1 id="head"> Roll of ipl in cricket world</h1>
<p id="para">The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a domestic, annual Twenty20 cricket tournament
     in India,[3][4] organized by the IPL Governing Council, under the aegis of the Board 
     of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[5][6] It is the most watched Twenty20 tournament
      and the second-best paying[notes 1] sporting league globally.[7][8][9]

    IPL was established in 2008[6] and currently consists of eight teams in eight cities across
     India.[10][11] The inaugural IPL season was won by Rajasthan Royals.[12] As of May 2019,
      there have been twelve seasons of the IPL tournament.[13][11] The latest season was conducted
       from March to May 2019, with Mumbai Indians winning the title.[14]
    
    The IPL tournament involves each team playing every other team twice in a home-and-away,
     double round-robin format.[15][16] At the conclusion of the double round-robin league, on the 
     basis of aggregate points, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs.[17][18] In this stage,
      the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining
       two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator").[19] While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies
       f for the final match, the losing team gets another chance to qualify for the final match by playing 
       the winning team of the Eliminator match; this match is titled Qualifier 2.[15][19] The winner of this 
       subsequent Qualifier 2 match moves onto the final match.[19] The team that wins the final match is crowned 
       the Indian Premier League champion.[19]
       <p id="para">Altogether, thirteen teams have played in the past ten seasons of the IPL tournament.[20][21][22]
        Of these, five teams are no longer a part of the tournament.[10] In 2011, BCCI terminated the franchise
         of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for contractual breach.[23] Similarly, BCCI terminated the franchise of Deccan
          Chargers in 2012 for backing off from its commitments.[24] In 2013, Pune Warriors India exited IPL after
           it had a franchise valuation disagreement with BCCI.[22] Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were
            suspended in 2015 following a betting controversy. However, in July 2017, BCCI announced that both Chenna
            i Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals would be allowed back into the IPL competition from the 2018 season.[25][26]
             The tournament featured eight teams for the 2019 season, including Delhi Capitals,[notes 2] Kings XI Punjab,
              Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad 
              and Mumbai Indians.[14][27][28][29] </p>
    
    
          <p id="para">Mumbai Indians is the most successful team in league history, having won four titles.[30] Chennai Super Kings,
            Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals, apart from former team Deccan Chargers, are
             the other teams to have won the tournament title as of May 2019.[14][29][21]
